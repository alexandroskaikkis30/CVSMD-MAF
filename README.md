# CV-SMD/MAF
This project investigates the non-equilibrium mechanical unfolding of the villin headpiece (PDB: 2RJY) using TorchMD framework to perform constant-velocity steered molecular dynamics simulations. Conditional Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) models were trained on trajectory data conditioned on physical observables such as molecular extension and pulling force.

# Overview
This study explores the non-equilibrium mecahnical unfolding of villin headpiece (PDB: 2RJY) by employing steered molecular dynamics simulations using the constant-velocity pulling method, through the TorchMD framework. A pulling protocol similar to that described by Bustamante et al. (2020) in Single-Molecule Studies of Protein Folding with Optical Tweezers was implemented. In this CV-SMD configuration, the pulling mechanism is defined by two reference points that move in opposite directions along the x-axis at constant velocity. Each of the two terminal atoms is harmonically restrained to one of these moving reference points, generating time-dependent forces that drive the unfolding process. This configuration is designed to mimic the physical conditions of Bustamanteâ€™s optical tweezers experiment, which is performed in a thermal bath allowing continuous energy exchange between the system and its environment. In TorchMD, temperature control required for the canonical (NVT) ensemble is achieved through its built-in integrator class, and a Langevin integrator was employed to maintain constant temperature throughout the simulation.
