# CV-SMD/MAF
This project investigates the non-equilibrium mechanical unfolding of the villin headpiece (PDB: 2RJY) using TorchMD framework to perform constant-velocity steered molecular dynamics simulations. Conditional Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) models were trained on trajectory data conditioned on physical observables such as molecular extension and pulling force.

# Overview
This study explores the non-equilibrium mecahnical unfolding of villin headpiece (PDB: 2RJY) by employing steered molecular dynamics simulations using the constant-velocity pulling method, through the TorchMD framework. This study aims to replicate the unfolding mechanism described in Bsutamante et all work ....
