# CVSMD-MAF
This project investigates the non-equilibrium mechanical unfolding of the villin headpiece (PDB: 2RJY) using TorchMD framework to perform constant-velocity steered molecular dynamics simulations. Conditional normalising-flow (MAF) models were trained on trajectory data conditioned on physical observables such as molecular extension and pulling force.
